1. What columns violate 1NF?

- Dinner Date: The dinner_date column has different date formats. This violates 1NF because the date format should be consistent.
- Food Code and Food Description: The food_code and food_description columns contain multiple values separated by commas. This violates 1NF as each cell should contain atomic values.

2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?

- Members (member_id, member_name, member_address).
- Dinners (dinner_id, dinner_date, venue_code).
- Venues (venue_code, venue_description).
- Foods (food_code, food_description).

3. Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.
